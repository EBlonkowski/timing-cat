Many people do not know how to wait. Most of them think of it as lost time.
Some animals do not suffer from this defect. Watch as the cat waits before the window,
waiting for it to open. It doesn't whine, it doesn't get anxious wondering if the door
will open at last, or thinking it might be its fault.
